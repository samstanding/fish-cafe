# FishCafe

My client is a small pescatarian cafe and they asked for a small site to be built to drive business. Outside of their request I set up some configurations to aid in the development of the wesbite. The scope of this project focused on solely on the front-end. The next step in the project is to add a nodeJS server and connect that to my clients' Airtable database. That way they would be able to edit the content on the site, whenever they see fit. 

##Build With
Angular 6
SCSS

##Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Not required but nice to have [AngularCLI](https://cli.angular.io/)

##Installation

To get this running, clone or download the repo, and run `npm install` to install all dependencies, then run either `npm start` or `ng serve` (if you have the AngularCLI installed) to run the server. Your server will serve the app on localhost:4200.
